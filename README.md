# XRPLordsRemastered

The XRP network is full of rich transaction activity. The aim of this repo is to flag unusual activity (anomaly detection) and label accounts into three or more categories (holders, fake volume actors, and tumblers).

## Projects

1. Anomaly Detection
We want to use timeseries predictions with some threshold to help determine whether or not a transaction should be flagged or labeled as an anomaly. This may incorporate some linear regression into the timeseries prediction as well.
